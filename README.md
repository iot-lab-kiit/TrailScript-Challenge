## Instructions

## Hints

### `./src/pages/Login.jsx`

- The missing words are often the ones that speak the loudest. Dive into the input field's attributes to reveal the secrets.
- In the state of beginnings, an initial offering is expected. Look where values rest without a starting point, and you might uncover a hidden void waiting to be filled.

### `'./src/pages/Signup.jsx'`

- In the world of variables, constants stand strong. But what if a constant decides to shed its armor? Look for a declaration that has taken an unexpected turn.

### `'./src/pages/Success.jsx'`

- When functions lose their way, defaults can be a guiding light. Seek out the path that's been overlooked, where inputs roam free without a compass.

### `./src/components/Home.jsx`

- Pixels locked in a box, but what if they were set free to embrace curves? Seek a transformation that can turn corners into circles.

### `./src/components/Transactions.jsx`

- Keys unlock the map of React's world. If a hardcoded path triggers warnings, your treasure might be closer than you think. Trace the footsteps of the keys.

### `./src/components/SideBar.jsx`

- Functions often have something to say, but silence can be deafening. Check if your function is keeping its thoughts to itself, leaving a void where an answer should be.
